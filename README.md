# Hand-Tracking-with-OpenCV-and-MediaPipe
This project demonstrates real-time hand tracking using OpenCV and MediaPipe. The application captures video from the webcam, detects hands, and tracks their landmarks. It also displays the coordinates of the landmarks and the FPS (Frames Per Second) on the video feed.
